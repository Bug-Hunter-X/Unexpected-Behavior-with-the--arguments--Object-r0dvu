This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in JavaScript:  the misuse of the `arguments` object within functions. The `arguments` object appears array-like, but lacks many array methods. Attempting to use these methods directly often leads to unexpected results or errors. The solution showcases the proper way to handle the `arguments` object, either by converting it to a true array or iterating through it directly.
